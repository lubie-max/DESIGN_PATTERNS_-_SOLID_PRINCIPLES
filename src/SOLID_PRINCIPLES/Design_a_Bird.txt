Problem Statement -> Design a Bird
-  Create a system which tracks all type of birds
with respective of their attributes and behaviors


Approach ->

we can create a class named Bird
which will consist several methods and attributes
like
attributes -> age , color , weight , type etc., and
methods/behaviors -> fly() , makeSound() , eat() etc.

Problem in this Approach ->
let's say fly() method,  we can define the flying altitude of a bird based on its type.
what would happen
for every object of bird / for type of bird we will have to create if else condition.
